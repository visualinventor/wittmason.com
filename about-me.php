<p>I’m a dreamer and a doer. I’m a builder and a fixer. I’m old school and cutting edge.
Put simply, my world is a mashup of making new ideas come alive and bringing new life to old things.</p>

<p>Model trains have been a personal fascination since I was young child. It was a hobby my dad and I shared, and I now share it with my son. We enjoy our travels to train shows, searching for model trains to run on the model railways we create together. The Lego city we created is a favorite at train shows in Oklahoma and surrounding states.</p>

<p>I’ve designed and built a 3-D printer, using it to build things I can’t find elsewhere, I enjoy creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>I enjoy virtual adventures, too. I’m an avid WOW (World of Warcraft) player, with my son and friends, we explore virtual worlds

<p>I love web design and development for the same reasons I love my hobbies. Curiosity, risk-taking and attention to detail distinguishes my work. I’m not afraid to learn or to fail. I established my own graphic and web design/development business while in college and successfully operated as an entrepreneur for 14 years.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of my professional life, I embraced the opportunity to build new ways for an old industry to deepen its bond with the community, grow new relationships and expand its influence.</p>

<p>In this next chapter, I want to build on all I’ve learned to keep creating, fixing and improving.</p>

<p>Nothing is more important than faith and family. My wife Christy and I met in college and married after graduation. We have a daughter, a son and a Corgi who fill our lives with laughter and love. One of our favorite family activities is rooting for the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
